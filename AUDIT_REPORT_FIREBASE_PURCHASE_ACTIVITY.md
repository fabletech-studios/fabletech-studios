# Firebase Purchase History & Activity Tracking Audit Report

**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Target Account:** omvectuning@gmail.com  
**Purpose:** Investigate reported issues with purchase history pricing and episode unlock activity tracking

## Executive Summary

I have created a comprehensive audit system to investigate the reported issues with purchase history showing incorrect prices and activity tracking not recording episode unlocks properly. The audit system includes:

1. **Direct Firebase Query Scripts** - Scripts to query Firebase data directly
2. **API-based Audit Endpoint** - A new admin API endpoint for comprehensive customer auditing
3. **Automated Discrepancy Detection** - Logic to identify pricing and tracking issues

## Audit System Components Created

### 1. Firebase Direct Query Script (`/scripts/audit-firebase-client.js`)

A Node.js script that directly queries Firebase using the client SDK to:
- Find customers by email address
- Analyze credit transactions for pricing discrepancies
- Review user activities for tracking completeness
- Perform data consistency checks
- Generate detailed reports

### 2. Admin API Audit Endpoint (`/app/api/admin/audit-customer/route.ts`)

A comprehensive REST API endpoint at `/api/admin/audit-customer` that:
- Accepts email as input parameter
- Queries multiple Firebase collections simultaneously
- Validates transaction amounts against expected package prices
- Checks activity tracking completeness
- Returns structured audit results with recommendations

### 3. Test Scripts

- **API Test Script** (`/scripts/test-audit-api.js`) - Tests the audit API endpoint
- **Package Script** (`npm run audit:firebase`) - Easy command to run audits

## Expected Package Pricing Configuration

The audit system validates against these expected values:

| Package | Credits | Price | Display |
|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| Starter Pack | 50 | 499 cents | $4.99 |
| Popular Pack | 100 | 999 cents | $9.99 |
| Premium Pack | 200 | 1999 cents | $19.99 |

## Database Collections Audited

### 1. `customers` Collection
- Customer profile data
- Current credit balance
- Unlocked episodes array
- Statistics (episodes unlocked, credits spent)

### 2. `credit-transactions` Collection
- Purchase transactions with package IDs and amounts
- Spend transactions for episode unlocks
- Bonus credit transactions
- Transaction metadata and timestamps

### 3. `userActivities` Collection
- Episode unlock events
- Credit purchase events
- Other user activities with metadata

## Audit Checks Performed

### Purchase Price Validation
- **Check 1:** Actual transaction amounts vs expected package prices
- **Check 2:** Credits received vs expected credits per package
- **Check 3:** Package ID consistency in transaction records

### Activity Tracking Validation
- **Check 4:** Episode unlock activities vs customer unlocked episodes
- **Check 5:** Activity timestamps and metadata completeness
- **Check 6:** Activity type distribution and patterns

### Data Consistency Validation
- **Check 7:** Credit balance calculation vs actual balance
- **Check 8:** Statistics consistency across collections
- **Check 9:** Duplicate customer detection

## Issues That Would Be Detected

### Purchase History Issues
1. **Incorrect Pricing** - Transactions with wrong amounts compared to package prices
2. **Credit Miscalculation** - Wrong number of credits awarded for packages
3. **Missing Transaction Data** - Incomplete Stripe webhook processing
4. **Package ID Errors** - Wrong package identifiers in transactions

### Activity Tracking Issues
1. **Missing Episode Unlock Activities** - Unlocks not recorded in userActivities
2. **Inconsistent Statistics** - Mismatch between customer stats and actual data
3. **Incomplete Metadata** - Missing series/episode information in activities
4. **Timestamp Issues** - Incorrect or missing activity timestamps

### Data Integrity Issues
1. **Credit Balance Discrepancies** - Calculated balance vs stored balance
2. **Duplicate Customer Records** - Multiple records for same email
3. **Orphaned Transactions** - Transactions without corresponding customer
4. **Missing Activity Types** - Expected activities not being recorded

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed
- Comprehensive audit logic implemented
- Package price validation system
- Activity tracking verification
- Data consistency checks
- Detailed reporting with recommendations
- Both script and API approaches created

### ⚠️ Blocked by Configuration
The audit system cannot be fully tested due to:
- **Firebase Admin SDK credentials missing** - The `.env.local` file contains placeholder values
- **Service account configuration needed** - Proper Firebase service account JSON required
- **Database permissions** - Admin access needed for full audit capabilities

## Required Configuration for Testing

To complete the audit testing, you need:

1. **Firebase Service Account Credentials:**
   ```
   FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_ACTUAL_PRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
   ```

2. **Or Firebase Service Account JSON:**
   ```
   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=path/to/serviceAccountKey.json
   ```

## How to Use the Audit System

### Option 1: API Endpoint (Recommended)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/audit-customer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"omvectuning@gmail.com"}'
```

### Option 2: Direct Script
```bash
npm run audit:firebase
```

### Option 3: Test Script with Formatted Output
```bash
node scripts/test-audit-api.js
```

## Audit Report Structure

The audit system generates reports with these sections:

### Customer Summary
- Basic customer information
- Current credit balance
- Account statistics

### Transaction Analysis
- Total purchases, spends, bonuses
- Amount validation against expected prices
- Credit calculation verification

### Activity Analysis
- Activity counts by type
- Episode unlock tracking verification
- Metadata completeness

### Consistency Checks
- Credit balance reconciliation
- Episode unlock count consistency
- Cross-collection data validation

### Issues Detection
- Purchase price discrepancies
- Missing activity records
- Data integrity problems

### Recommendations
- Specific actions to fix detected issues
- System improvements needed
- Monitoring suggestions

## Testing Recommendations

Once Firebase credentials are configured:

1. **Test with Known Good Account** - Use an account with verified transactions
2. **Test with Problem Account** - Use omvectuning@gmail.com to identify specific issues
3. **Test Edge Cases** - Accounts with no transactions, duplicate records, etc.
4. **Validate Fixes** - Re-run audit after implementing recommendations

## Implementation Quality

The audit system includes:
- **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of missing data and API failures
- **Detailed Logging** - Comprehensive output for debugging
- **Flexible Input** - Works with any email address
- **Structured Output** - Machine-readable JSON and human-readable formatting
- **Extensible Design** - Easy to add new checks and validations

## Security Considerations

- Admin endpoints require proper authentication (to be implemented)
- Firebase credentials must be kept secure
- Audit logs should not expose sensitive customer data
- API rate limiting should be implemented for production use

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Firebase Credentials** - Add proper service account credentials
2. **Test Audit System** - Run comprehensive tests with real data
3. **Fix Identified Issues** - Implement recommendations from audit results
4. **Monitor Going Forward** - Set up regular audit checks
5. **Add Authentication** - Secure admin endpoints with proper auth

This audit system provides the foundation for identifying and resolving the reported purchase history and activity tracking issues. Once Firebase credentials are properly configured, it will provide detailed insights into data integrity and system performance.
