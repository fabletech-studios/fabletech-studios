### Step 3: Configure Email Forwarding

Set up forwarding rules to manage emails efficiently:

1. **Support Forwarding**
   - Forward support@fabletech.studio → Your personal email
   - Keep copy in mailbox: Yes

2. **Billing Forwarding**
   - Forward billing@fabletech.studio → Your personal email
   - Keep copy in mailbox: Yes

### Step 4: Configure Email Clients

#### IONOS Webmail Access
- URL: https://mail.ionos.com
- Username: Full email address
- Password: As set above

#### IMAP Settings (for email clients)
```
Incoming Server (IMAP):
- Server: imap.ionos.com
- Port: 993
- Security: SSL/TLS
- Username: Full email address
- Password: As set

Outgoing Server (SMTP):
- Server: smtp.ionos.com
- Port: 587
- Security: STARTTLS
- Authentication: Required
- Username: Full email address
- Password: As set
```

### Step 5: Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC

Add these DNS records in IONOS:

#### SPF Record
```
Type: TXT
Host: @
Value: "v=spf1 include:_spf.ionos.com ~all"
TTL: 3600
```

#### DKIM (if available in IONOS)
```
Follow IONOS instructions to enable DKIM
This helps prevent email spoofing
```

#### DMARC Record
```
Type: TXT
Host: _dmarc
Value: "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:admin@fabletech.studio"
TTL: 3600
```

## Email Integration with Application

Create `.env` variables:
```bash
# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.ionos.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=noreply@fabletech.studio
SMTP_PASS=your-smtp-password

# Business Emails
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@fabletech.studio
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@fabletech.studio
BILLING_EMAIL=billing@fabletech.studio
FROM_EMAIL=FableTech Studio <noreply@fabletech.studio>
```

### Step 2: Configure Nodemailer (if using)

```typescript
import nodemailer from 'nodemailer';

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,
  port: parseInt(process.env.SMTP_PORT || '587'),
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.SMTP_USER,
    pass: process.env.SMTP_PASS,
  },
});

export async function sendEmail(to: string, subject: string, html: string) {
  const mailOptions = {
