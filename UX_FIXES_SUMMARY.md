# User Experience Fixes Summary

## 1. Activity Tracking ✅

### Implementation:
- Created `lib/firebase/activity-service.ts` for tracking user activities
- Activities tracked:
  - Episode unlocks (with series/episode info and credits spent)
  - Credit purchases (with amount and cost)
  - Future: Episode watches (can be added)

### Updated Endpoints:
- `/api/customer/unlock-episode/route.ts` - Tracks when users unlock episodes
- `/api/customer/purchase-credits/route.ts` - Tracks credit purchases

### Profile Page Updates:
- Recent Activity section now displays real user activities
- Shows activity descriptions with timestamps (e.g., "2 hours ago")
- Displays episode titles when available

## 2. Navigation Consistency ✅

### Pages Updated:
- **Homepage** - Already had CustomerHeader ✅
- **Browse Page** - Already had CustomerHeader ✅
- **Profile Page** - Added CustomerHeader (replaced custom header) ✅
- **Watch Page** - Has its own header with episode info + credits display

### CustomerHeader Features:
- Shows credit balance with icon
- "Buy Credits" button (responsive - shows "Buy" on mobile)
- Profile link with username
- Consistent across all pages

## 3. Testing Instructions

### Complete User Flow:
1. **Login** → Customer logs in
2. **Browse** → Navigate to browse page
   - CustomerHeader visible with credits
3. **Watch Episode** → Click on an episode
   - If locked, unlock with credits (activity tracked)
   - Watch the episode
4. **Check Profile** → Navigate to profile
   - Recent Activity shows "Unlocked Episode X of [Series Name]"
   - Shows timestamps for all activities
5. **Purchase Credits** → Click "Buy Credits"
   - Complete purchase
   - Activity tracked: "Purchased X credits for $Y"

### What's Working:
- ✅ Activity tracking for unlocks and purchases
- ✅ Recent Activity display in profile
- ✅ Consistent navigation on all pages
- ✅ Credit balance always visible
- ✅ Responsive design maintained

### Database Structure:
Activities are stored in Firestore `userActivities` collection with:
- userId
- type (episode_unlocked, credits_purchased, etc.)
- description
- metadata (episode details, amounts, etc.)
- createdAt timestamp

## Notes:
- Episode watch tracking can be added by calling `addUserActivity` when video playback starts
- All activities are automatically timestamped and sorted by most recent
- The system is extensible for future activity types
