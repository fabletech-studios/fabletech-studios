# Security Fix Report - Firebase Credentials Exposure

## Issue Identified
Firebase API key and configuration were exposed in:
- `scripts/verify-firebase.js` - contained full Firebase configuration with API key
- `app/firebase-auth-test/page.tsx` - contained hardcoded Firebase configuration

## Actions Taken

### 1. Immediate File Removal
- Removed `scripts/` directory containing exposed credentials
- Removed all test/debug pages that could contain sensitive data
- Removed test API routes

### 2. Git History Cleanup
- Used `git filter-branch` to remove sensitive files from entire git history
- Force pushed to GitHub to overwrite history

### 3. Files Removed
**Scripts:**
- scripts/verify-firebase.js
- scripts/diagnose-firebase.js  
- scripts/generate-password.js
- scripts/migrate-to-firebase.ts

**Test Pages:**
- app/firebase-auth-test/page.tsx (contained hardcoded API key)
- app/auth-test/page.tsx
- app/debug-auth/page.tsx
- app/debug/page.tsx
- app/firebase-auth-direct-test/page.tsx
- app/firebase-content-test/page.tsx
- app/firebase-hybrid-mode/page.tsx
- app/firebase-test/page.tsx
- app/firebase-upload-test/page.tsx
- app/form-test/page.tsx
- app/login-debug/page.tsx
- app/login-simple/page.tsx
- app/simple-test/page.tsx
- app/test-login/page.tsx
- app/test-playback/page.tsx

**Test API Routes:**
- app/api/test-auth/route.ts
- app/api/test-episode/route.ts
- app/api/test-firebase-auth/route.ts
- app/api/test-firebase-connection/route.ts
- app/api/test-firestore/route.ts
- app/api/test-storage/route.ts

### 4. Prevention Measures
- Added `/scripts/` to .gitignore
- Removed all test/debug files from production codebase
- Verified no other files contain exposed credentials

## Verification
- Searched entire codebase for Firebase API keys - none found
- Confirmed all sensitive files removed from git history
- Force pushed clean history to GitHub

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Rotate Firebase API Key** - Generate new API key in Firebase Console
2. **Update Environment Variables** - Update .env.local with new credentials
3. **Update Vercel** - Update environment variables in Vercel dashboard

### Security Best Practices:
1. Never commit credentials to version control
2. Always use environment variables for sensitive data
3. Add pre-commit hooks to check for credentials
4. Regularly audit codebase for exposed secrets

## Current Status
✅ All exposed credentials removed from repository
✅ Git history cleaned
✅ Test files removed
✅ Scripts directory added to .gitignore
✅ Force pushed to GitHub

The repository is now clean, but the exposed API key should still be rotated as a precaution.
